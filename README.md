soon to be implemented

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the development server

```bash
npx expo start
```

### 3. Using tunnel

```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

# TL;DR 
```The app is functionally complete, but the codebase is still messy and will be cleaned up over time.```
